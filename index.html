    <p>Knowing that Vicksburg was well defended, General Grant decided 
    that the best way to capture this key city would be to deprive them of 
    much needed food and resourses.  He belived that this would be the
    best way to perserve his army.  So, on May 18, 1863 the seige began 
    and would last 6 weeks.</p>
