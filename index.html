   <h1>The Surrender of Vicksburg, MS July 4, 1863</h1>

    <p>During the Spring and Summer of 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant,
    of the Union Army, surrounded and laid siege to the Confederate held 
    city of Vicksburg, Mississippi during the American Civil War.<p>

    <p>Knowing that Vicksburg was well defended, General Grant decided 
    that the best way to capture this key city would be to deprive them of 
    much needed food and resourses.  He believed that this action would be the
    best way to perserve his army.  So, on <b>May 19, 1863</b> the seige began 
    and would last for 6 long weeks.</p>

    <p>The 6 week seige took it's toll on the city of Vicksburg, its 
        citizens and the confederate army that was defending it.  The 
        lack of food and constant artillery bombardments was more than
        the city could take and on <b>July 4th, 1863</b>, the city and the confederate
        army holding it, surrendered.</p>
